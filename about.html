        <h1>OUR VISION

            We dream of Filipinos who passionately love their country and whose competencies and values enable them to realize their full potential and contribute meaningfully to building the nation.
            
            As a learner-centered public institution, the Department of Education continuously improves itself to better serve its stakeholders.
            
            OUR MISSION
            
            To protect and promote the right of every Filipino to quality, equitable, culture-based, and complete basic education where:
            
            Students learn in a child-friendly, gender-sensitive, safe, and motivating environment.
            
            Teachers facilitate learning and constantly nurture every learner.
            
            Administrators and staff, as stewards of the institution, ensure an enabling and supportive environment for effective learning to happen.
            
            Family, community, and other stake- holders are actively engaged and share responsibility for developing life-long learners.
            
            OUR CORE VALUES
            
            Maka-Diyos, Makatao, Makakalikasan, Makabansa</h1>
